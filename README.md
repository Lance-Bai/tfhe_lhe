# TFHE Leveled Homomorphic Evaluation

This repository contains the implementation and experimental code for "Refined TFHE Leveled Homomorphic Evaluation and Its Application" submitted to ACM CCS.

## Abstract

This artifact provides two complementary implementations demonstrating our refined TFHE leveled homomorphic evaluation techniques. The repository showcases novel approaches to improving the efficiency of fully homomorphic encryption through optimized computational flows and advanced mathematical transforms.

## Paper Contributions

This artifact demonstrates the following key contributions:

- **Enhanced NTT-based LHE scheme**: Significantly improves the efficiency of Number Theoretic Transform-based Leveled Homomorphic Evaluation by optimizing the computational flow and reducing overhead.

- **Novel FFT-based LHE scheme**: Introduces a new Leveled Homomorphic Evaluation construction based on Fast Fourier Transform, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

- **Transciphering application**: Provides comprehensive evaluation of transciphering tasks using our LHE schemes, demonstrating real-world performance improvements.

- **Integer-input LHE extension**: Extends the FFT-based LHE scheme from binary input operations to support integer inputs, broadening its practical applicability.
